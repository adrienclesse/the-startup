          <div class="ourlove"> <span class="firstline"> Some history </span> <br>It all started with the very first stone in our pillar of cocktails: 
              "Mama Franklin". She was an American nurse who, back in 1917, came to help in World War I. 
              Besides aiding the many soldiers fallen front battlefield, she also had a knack for making drinks.
              Rest assured, no soldier complained and many returned, even after the war was over. 
              <br> <br>Due to an issue with the boats, Mama Franklin was left stranded on the very beaches of Normandy. 
              Earning a living as nomadic bar maiden, she arrived in Belgium. 
              <br><br>
              What more is there to say? Nightly cocktails was born! <br>
              Many years later, we now run a proud company with the same flexibily as Mama Franklin.
              So try us out! Wether you are a modern day fallen soldier or not, 
              no soul on this planet should be left alone without a drink.
