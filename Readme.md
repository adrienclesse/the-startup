# The Startup

## Instructions

The objective of this project was to learn to team up with other becode learners in order of creating a comercial website.

## Our startup's website

Our team, composed of Nour, Florian, Aimal and Adrien, has decided to design an online delivery cocktail bar. We've divided the website in 4 main pages :

- The main page
- The about us page
- The contact page
- The online shop

Each of us has decided to focus on one the page.  Nevertheless, we've all agreed that comunication has to be the key value for our project and that it's important to keep other updated.

## Main page

We've decided to make an simple and designed main page with a background image.  We've set the navbar on top of the main page and we made our logo a button that links to the online shop. The background has been used only for this page as the rest of the site should be more sober.  Some animations have been added to make it more interactive.

## About us page

For the 'About Us' we wanted to use a simple page that showed some of our history, while introducing our team and some company values. 
The biggest issue we had was the contrast with the home page, which is a wide and colourful page.
We wanted some unity in our pages but at the same time every page has a different goal so different means were needed. By introducing a few divs as 'side borders' (in flexbox) to the body, we got rid of that body. 
In the end the page used a grid inside flexbox. Very usefull technique!

## The contact page

The contact page was a tricky page since there are alot of interactive elements, such as a google maps windows and links to our social media. It was best to use bootstrap to resolve our javascript issues. 
Overall the page turned out great with a lot of bright colours without overdoing it and all scripts are functional.
