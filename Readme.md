# The Startup

## Instructions

The objective of this project was to learn to team up with other becode learners in order of creating a comercial website.

## Our startup's website

Our team, composed of Nour, Florian, Aimal and Adrien, has decided to design an online delivery cocktail bar. We've divided the website in 4 main pages :

- The main page
- The about us page
- The contact page
- The online shop

Each of us has decided to focus on one the page.  Nevertheless, we've all agreed that comunication has to be the key value for our project and that it's important to keep other updated.

## Main page

We've decided to make the logo a button and to set the navbar on top of the main page already
